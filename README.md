# Computational Neuroscience
Implementation of some of the basic neural models and simulation of interactions between neurons in a population and learning process from scratch in Python.

- [Implementation of LIF (Leaky integrate-and-fire), Adatptive LIF, and Adaptive Exponential LIF models](models/)
- [Simulation of neural population](population/)
- [Implementation of Spiking Neural network and STDP learning rule](SNN/)
